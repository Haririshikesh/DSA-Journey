## How to Use/Navigate
## Prerequisites

Solutions are organized by DSA topic in separate folders. Each folder contains Java files with the problem solutions.
Before you can run any of the solutions, you will need to have the following software installed on your system:

## How to Run 
This project uses Maven. You can compile and run any solution using the provided `run.sh` script.
The script handles the compilation and execution.
 
`./run.sh <fully.qualified.ClassName>`
eg. `./run.sh com.rishi.dsa.trees.binary_tree_maximum_path_sum.Main`
1.  **Git**: To clone the repository.
2.  **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 21 or higher.
